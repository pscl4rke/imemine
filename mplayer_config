#======================================================================#


#       As a general rule mplayer satisfies me pretty well
#       straight out of the box, but there's so many config
#       options it seems a shame not to use any of them.


[default]


# ON-SCREEN DISPLAY {{{
#   This configures the progress information that the `o` and `P` keys
#   display.  Only affects the digits - the progress bar is hard-coded.
osd-duration=5000
#}}}


# TERMINAL OUTPUT {{{
#   This tries to minimise the text on the terminal to only proper errors.
#   Except for the status line, which is actually useful.  Interestingly
#   everything gets sent to stderr except for the status line, so some
#   careful bitbucket usage could clean it up further.
#   vfilter: Used by -vf cropdetect
msgmodule=yes
#msglevel=all=1:statusline=5
#msglevel=all=0:statusline=5
msglevel=all=0:vfilter=5:statusline=5
#msglevel=all=3:statusline=5:cplayer=3
#}}}


# DEACTIVATING THE SCREENSAVER {{{
#   This assumes I'm using xscreensaver.  It will be silent either way.
heartbeat-cmd="xscreensaver-command -deactivate >>/dev/null 2>&1"
#}}}


# WINDOW APPEARANCE
#   Use the filename of the current item as the window title.
#   This is often easier than typing 'I' to use the OSD.
use-filename-title=yes


# STUPID BUGS
#   There's a bug in old versions of pulseaudio (like the one
#   in Wheezy) that miscalculates durations and causes mplayer
#   to not realise it's at the end of the file.  So bypass it.

#ao=alsa
#   If the right modeset isn't done at boot then videos aren't
#   stretched to fill the window.  This fixes it.
#zoom=yes


# PLAYING DVDS
#  Use "-chapter n-n" on cmd line to play just chapter n.

# AUDIO FILES
#   Don't bother creating a window to display embedded images.
