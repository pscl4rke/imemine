! Currently only used for urxvt (rxvt-unicode).
! Note that this file gets ignored if an .Xresources one exists.
! It is read every time an application starts up.
! It needs a little tidy up.



! WINDOW STYLING
!   Use a nice icon and keep things minimal.  The title is
!   usually overriden by programs (esp. the bash $PS1)
URxvt.iconFile: /home/psc/imemine/ctermbg/terminal.22x22.png

URxvt.title: Terminal


! WINDOW SIZE
!   It turns out that if I want to have four characters of
!   line numbering in the left-hand margin then I need to
!   have four characters more width!  I usually resize my
!   windows into a grid layout anyway.
URxvt.geometry: 84x25


! INACTIVE WINDOWS
!   Years ago I used a the Compiz 'ADD' plugin, which shaded
!   inactive windows to make them less distracting.   I found
!   it was helpful in making it obvious which window had the
!   current focus, and I've wanted it back every since.  This
!   only applies to terminal windows, but it does sort-of work.
!   I'll probably adjust the percentage/colour over time.
darkterm*fading: 25
darkterm*fadeColor: #440066
lightterm*fading: 35
lightterm*fadeColor: #002b36


! SCROLLING
!   Maintain a separate space for the secondary screen so it
!   doesn't mangle the first one's history.  Then allow the
!   user to browse through the history without new output
!   causing it to jump to the bottom.  New input will make it
!   jump.  By default it seems to have 1024 lines of scroll.
!   I calculate the worst case is each terminal needs 1.5
!   megabytes more RAM by increasing this.

! TEXT RENDERING
!   This font is usually available.

! KEYBINDINGS
!   These disable the Ctrl+Shift unicode entering because it clashes
!   with some of the keybindings in my window manager
URxvt.iso14755: false
URxvt.iso14755_52: false


! UNUSED THINGS
!   A tiled background looks nice, but urxvt takes _ages_
!   to repaint its screen, so it doesn't work.
!URxvt.backgroundPixmap: /home/psc/imemine/ctermbg/purple.gif;tile
!   Transparency makes it hard to read, and tinting only makes the
!   background darker, which doesn't work in lightterm mode.
!URxvt.transparent: true
!URxvt.tintColor: #eeeeee
!Urxvt.shading: 190
!Urxvt.blurRadius: 64


! start with `urxvt -name foo` to activate these:
foo*foreground: #FF0000

! This seems to be ignored:
!include /home/psc/foo.defaults
