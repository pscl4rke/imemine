! Currently only used for urxvt (rxvt-unicode).
! Note that this file gets ignored if an .Xresources one exists.
! It is read every time an application starts up.
! It needs a good tidy up.



! WINDOW STYLING
!   Use a nice icon and keep things minimal.
!   Don't let the primary screen's scroll history get mangled
!   by the secondary screen.
URxvt.iconFile: /home/psc/imemine/ctermbg/terminal.22x22.png
URxvt.scrollBar: false
URxvt.secondaryScroll: false


! WINDOW SIZE
!   It turns out that if I want to have four characters of
!   line numbering in the left-hand margin then I need to
!   have four characters more width!  I usually resize my
!   windows into a grid layout anyway.
URxvt.geometry: 84x25


! WINDOW TITLING
!   This is almost always overridden by whatever is running
!   inside (e.g. the PS1 of the shell), but it does appear
!   briefly, so I make it look nicer than `urxvt`.
URxvt.title: Terminal


URxvt.background: #000000
URxvt.foreground: gray90


! INACTIVE WINDOWS
!   Years ago I used a the Compiz 'ADD' plugin, which shaded
!   inactive windows to make them less distracting.   I found
!   it was helpful in making it obvious which window had the
!   current focus, and I've wanted it back every since.  This
!   only applies to terminal windows, but it does sort-of work.
!   I'll probably adjust the percentage/colour over time.
URxvt.fading: 25

! UNUSED THINGS
!   A tiled background looks nice, but urxvt takes _ages_
!   to repaint its screen, so it doesn't work.
!URxvt.backgroundPixmap: /home/psc/imemine/ctermbg/purple.gif;tile


! start with `urxvt -name foo` to activate these:

! This seems to be ignored:
