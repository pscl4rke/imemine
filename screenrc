#======================================================================#


#     NOTE: These are only settings that apply for my own personal
#       screens.  I may well be using different screenrcs if I'm
#       using screen for work or to keep services running.
#       This isn't complete.  I shall keep working on it until I
#       have things like the hardstatus sorted.


# ALTSCREEN
#   I shall put this in right near the start, because it seems
#   ridiculous that such a feature is disabled by default.  Altscreen
#   allows programs like less to launch on a 'virtual' screen over
#   the original one, which disappears completely when the program
#   exits, so I go back to the command line that I left.
altscreen on


# MULTIUSER
#   Terribly useful little option that allows a user to log on multiple
#   times from different connections and hook up and use the same
#   screen.
multiuser on


# THE DREADED BELL
#   As a general rule I prefer a visual bell to an annoying noise,
#   but lots of screens just flash at me, which is even worse.  Until
#   that is fixed, I enable the beep in screen and hope that it can
#   be disabled elsewhere.
vbell off


# INITIAL SETTNGS
#   I'm generally happy with just the one shell window when a screen
#   starts, but I do wish it wouldn't keep giving me its licensing
#   arrangements everytime it starts.
startup_message off


# SCREEN LOCKING
#   Arrgh!  No.  No.  No.   If this was locking the session it
#   might have made sense, but it locks up the terminal instead.
#   No program should EVER be allowed to completely ignore
#   keyboard interrupts.
bind x screen


# WINDOW TITLES
#   The `hardstatus` has got to be one of the most confusing
#   parts of screen, and not just because of all the escape
#   sequences.  It often runs along the bottom like the captions,
#   but if it is turned 'off' and the right terminal sequences
#   programmed in then it can set the window title as well.

hardstatus off
hardstatus string '[screen] %t'


# STATUS LINE
#   The caption runs along the bottom of every window.
#   If the screen has been split (horizontally or vertically)
#   then multiple captions are shown.  It's mostly there as
#   a reminder to me that I'm still inside a screen session.
#   It's possible to fill this with different colours, and one
#   day I might do that, but then the definition becomes
#   impossible to read.
caption always
caption string ' %n: %t %= %Y-%m-%d %c '
