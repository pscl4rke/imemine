#                        MUTT PREFERENCES FILE                         #
#======================================================================#


#     USAGE: This file contains Mutt preferences that are
#       carried accross multiple sites.  Place host-specific
#       information in your .muttrc, and then source these
#       preferences with "source ~/.muttrc-prefs".


#     NOTE: I don't actually use Mutt from day to day.  In
#       fact, I haven't even decided whether Mutt is my
#       preferred terminal mail client.  But when I do use
#       it the following settings are quite handy.


# KEYS
#   For some crazy reason the keys in the pager jump around
#   different messages instead of just scrolling up and down.
#   Generally speaking, making this more less-like.
bind pager j next-line
bind pager k previous-line
bind index G bottom-page
bind pager G bottom


# HELP BAR
#   I don't feel I need the help bar anymore.  I can always type
#   '?' if I need the current keybindings.
unset help


# WRITING AND REPLYING
#   Use vim as the editor for emails etc.  And ask it to use tabbed
#   mode, because that should be its default anyway.
set editor="vim -p"
set forward_format="Fwd: %s"


# RANDOM STUFF
#   Puts vim-style tildes on all lines between a message ending
#   and the bottom of the terminal.
set tilde=yes
set menu_scroll="yes"


# EXITING BEHAVIOUR
#   Don't delete anything, but do ask me if I want to leave
#   (because reloading IMAP is particularly slow).
set quit=ask-yes
set delete=no


# THE INDEX FORMAT
#   I am undecided exactly how I like my index lines to be
#   displayed, so here are some different options.
# Default:
#set index_format="%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%?l?%4l&%4c?) %s"
# With dates on the right:
set index_format="%4C %Z %-15.15L (%?l?%4l&%4c?) %?M?+(%M)&? %s %*  %{%e %b}"


# COLOURS
#   Here are a bunch of colours that make using Mutt a bit
#   more agreeable than some of the defaults that I've seen.
#   They aren't too disimilar from the default Tig colourings
#   that I've seen.
# The messages that get displayed below the status bar:
color message white default
# This covers the normal email lists (index):
color normal white default
# This is the tree for showing threads:
color tree red default
# This is the cursor which selects messages:
color indicator white green
# These set the quotation levels:
color quoted  blue default
color quoted1 blue default
color quoted2 blue default
color quoted3 blue default
# This fills the rest of the pager when the message has finished:
color tilde brightblack default
# This is the indicator when a line is wrapped
color markers brightblack default
# This is for the mail headers in the pager:
color hdrdefault brightwhite default
# These don't seem to make much difference:
color signature white default
color error white default


# THE LIST OF EMAILS
#   Here I highlight any unread or flagged messages, and try
#   to ignore deleted ones.
color index yellow default ~N
color index yellow default ~O
color index brightgreen default ~F
color index red default ~D


# VIEWING AN EMAIL
set pager_index_lines="8"
