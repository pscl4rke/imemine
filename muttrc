#     USAGE: This file contains Mutt preferences that are
#       carried across multiple sites.  Place host-specific
#       information in your .muttrc, and then source these
#       preferences with "source ~/.muttrc-prefs".


# NAVIGATION KEY-BINDINGS
#   For some crazy reason the keys in the pager jump around
#   different messages instead of just scrolling up and down.
#   Generally speaking, making this more less-like.
bind pager j next-line
bind pager <down> next-line
bind pager k previous-line
bind pager <up> previous-line
bind generic <left> noop
bind generic <right> noop
bind index,generic G last-entry
bind pager G bottom
bind pager } skip-quoted
bind generic,index <space> next-page
bind browser <tab> view-file
bind browser l select-entry


# ACTION KEY-BINDINGS
#   These rebind the commands that send messages so they are
#   prefixed by an 'm'.  It frees up the bare keys to be used
#   by things that are more useful to me.
bind index,pager m noop
macro index,pager mm "<mail>"
macro index,pager me "<edit>"
macro index,pager mr "<reply>"
macro index,pager mg "<group-reply>"
macro index,pager mf "<forward-message>"
macro index,pager mb "<bounce-message>"
bind index,pager e noop
bind index,pager r noop
bind index,generic g first-entry
bind pager g top
bind index,pager f noop
bind index,pager b noop


# DELETING
#   I don't want deleting enabled by default.  Partly to stop me
#   accidentally deleting things from accounts where that isn't
#   desired, but also because services like Gmail carry out an
#   "archive" action instead of a "bin" one, making things messy.
#   On accounts where I do want to delete the `delete-message`
#   binding can be re-enabled in the config file.
# Was delete-thread:
bind index,pager \Cd noop
# Was delete-subthread:
bind index,pager <ESC>d noop
# Was delete-pattern
bind index,pager D noop
# Was delete-message:
bind index,pager d noop


# ARCHIVING
#   Actual rules will be defined in account-specific config files.
#   These double-check if archiving would create a new folder, but
#   don't if I'm filing into an existing folder.
set confirmappend=no
set confirmcreate=yes


# VIEWING ATTACHMENTS AND MESSAGES
#   By default Mutt will get the MIME type of a file from the header.
#   Some senders have badly behaved clients (e.g. thinking a CSV is
#   actually an Excel file).  This tells Mutt to ignore certain
#   types from the header, and instead use mime.types to look up the
#   MIME type from the file extension.
mime_lookup application/vnd.ms-excel


# SAVING ATTACHMENTS AND MESSAGES
#   The "editor" is the command line prompt at the bottom of the screen.
#   I disable "buffy-cycle" so that space actually works!!!
bind attach S save-entry
macro attach s "<save-entry><bol>~/Downloads/<eol>" "Save to ~/Downloads"
bind editor <space> noop


# PIPING MESSAGES INTO STUFF
#   These allow me to send messages into other programs.
#   Note that I will still get a Wait Key prompt if the
#   exit code is non-zero.
#   See http://dev.mutt.org/trac/wiki/MuttGuide/Macros
set wait_key="no"

macro index,pager |a "<pipe-message>$HOME/imemine/bin/addresses | less<enter>"


# FILTERING KEY-BINDINGS
#   By using the tilde as a prefix I can give myself different
#   views on the emails in a folder.  Using ~(...) will show an
#   entire thread where one message matches.
bind index ~ noop
macro index '~ ' "<limit>~C "

# DISPLAYING SMSs
#   The mmssms2mbox tool uses this address for 'my' address.  This tells
#   mutt about it so that it displays them as "To <dest>" in the sender
#   column of the index.
alternates me@example.com


# WRITING AND REPLYING
#   Don't bother asking if I want to include the original message.
#   Use vim as the editor for emails etc.  And ask it to use tabbed
#   mode, because that should be its default anyway.  I also want
#   to be able to edit the headers as well.
set include=yes
set editor="vim -p"
set forward_format="Fwd: %s"
set edit_headers
#   particularly useful for attribution (i.e. before quoted reply)
#   put a "!" at the beginning to use C locale (en-us)
set date_format="%a %-d %b %Y at %H:%M:%S %Z"


# PRINTING
#   Send emails through my own custom script, which itself calls
#   my own custom decoding script.
set print_decode=no
set print_command=/home/psc/imemine/bin/print-email
set print_split=yes


# RANDOM STUFF

set menu_scroll="yes"
bind index,pager R imap-fetch-mail


# ENTERING BEHAVIOUR
#   Don't bother asking me whether I want to create ~/Mail
#   every time I launch mutt with the -f option.
#   The downside is that <c><?> folder switcher breaks.
set folder="/dev/null"


# EXITING BEHAVIOUR
#   Ask me whether I really want to delete messages or exit
#   (because reloading IMAP is particularly slow).  And stop
#   making a distinction between Old and New unread messages.
set quit=ask-yes
set delete=ask-no

# VIEWING THE INDEX {{{
#   Here I highlight any unread or flagged messages, and try
#   to ignore deleted ones.
color index blue default ~N
color index blue default ~O
color index brightgreen default ~F
color index red default ~D
color index brightmagenta default ~T
#   I am undecided exactly how I like my index lines to be
#   displayed, so here are some different options.
# Default:
#set index_format="%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%?l?%4l&%4c?) %s"
# With dates on the right:
set index_format="%4C %Z %-15.15L (%?l?%4l&%4c?) %?M?+(%M)&? %?H?{%H} ?%s %*  %{%e %b}"
set spam_separator="} {"
# And the status line:
set status_format=" %f (%P) %> [%?V?%V&all?] %?V?%M/?%m msgs (%?V?%L/?%l)"
#}}}


# THREAD SUPPORT
#   Make use of threads in the index, and give some nice key
#   bindings for them.
#bind index <space> tag-thread
bind index - collapse-thread

# VIEWING AN EMAIL
#   Various behavioural tweaks for the pager mode.
set pager_index_lines="8"

#   This gives me the Date header in my own timezone without needing
#   to use `display_filter` to add in an extra header:
set pager_format="Message date is %[!%a %-d %b %Y at %H:%M:%S %Z] in my own timezone"


# MICROSOFT EXCHANGE INVITES AND HTML-ONLY EMAILS
#   Mutt only shows one part from multipart/alternative messages.
#   When I receive calendar invites they should be the first choice.
#   This uses a vcal script (as defined in mailcap) to show it instead
#   of the text/plain part (which always seems to be the description
#   anyway).
#   Then I read the plain text, and only render html if there's
#   nothing else.
alternative_order text/calendar text/plain text/*
auto_view text/calendar
auto_view text/html


# WINDOW TITLING
#   Note that these rely on the xtitles patch, which is usually
#   compiled in.
#   NOTE: If one plans on managing multiple accounts with multiple
#   mutt instances then it might be helpful to override this to
#   enable better window-manager switching.
set xterm_set_titles="yes"
# default: Mutt with %?m?%m messages&no messages?%?n? [%n NEW]?
set xterm_title="%m emails in %f (%n new %o old)"


# COLOURS IN INDEX
# The status bar near the bottom:
color status brightyellow blue
# The messages that get displayed below the status bar:
color message default default
color error default default
# This covers the normal email lists (index):
color normal default default
# This is the tree for showing threads:

# COLOURS IN PAGER

# This fills the rest of the pager when the message has finished:
color tilde brightblack default
# This is the indicator when a line is wrapped
color markers brightblack default
# This is for the mail headers in the pager:
color hdrdefault brightdefault default
# These don't seem to make much difference:
color signature white default
#
# When HTML leeches into the emails:
# (could use brightblack, but doesn't look as good)
# Tags:
color body magenta default "<[^>@]*>"
# Tags split across lines:
color body magenta default "<[[:alpha:]]*[[:space:]]*$"
color body magenta default "<[^>@]*\"[[:space:]]*$"
color body magenta default "^[^<>@]*\" ?>"
# Entities:
color body magenta default "&nbsp;"
#
# For patch emails containing unified diffs:
color body green default "^[+].*"
color body red default "^-.*"
