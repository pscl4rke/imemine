Photograph Directory Renamer
----------------------------

(c) 2013 P S Clarke

This is a highly opiniated script that I can use for renaming a directory
and all the photos contained in it to match my standard format:

    ./YYMMDD-NameOfPhotoShoot/YYMMDD-NameOfPhotoShoot NNN.jpg

It has been fairly hastily thrown together to partially replace an old
Windows tool that I had been using.
