# X SCREENSAVER
#   I had a lot of problems with the screen blanking after
#   10 minutes, even when playing videos.  However, neither
#   of the following worked from this script, even though
#   they were fine when run from the terminal.
#   I've stopped caring now, because mplayer seems to be
#   temporarily disabling it anyway.
#xset s 0 0
#xset s 43200   # 12 hours
#( sleep 30 && xset s 43200 ) &

# Laptop:
#   Use the menu key as the right-hand windows(tm) key (mod4):
#   This doesn't work, but as long as I have DISPLAY=0:0 I can
#   make it work in a cron job!

# MOUSE ALTERNATIVES
#   Keynav binds to Ctrl+; and lets you navigate to a part of
#   the screen and click on it.  Nice idea, but sadly it is
#   usually slower and fiddlier than just reaching for a mouse.
