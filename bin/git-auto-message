# This autogenerates a commit message from the currently staged changes.

# The messages it generates are awful, and break all the best practices
# for a software project.  However it is better than nothing for anything
# that needs to prepare commits non-interactively.  For example, a cron
# job synchronising a set of personal notes between machines.

# Output example:
#   "Add abc.txt, Edit def_eeeeeeeeeeee.html, Edit ghi.png"
