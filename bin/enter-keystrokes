#======================================================================#

# Best used by setting up window manager keybindings

# I used `xmacro` here, but found that `xdotool` would also work
# and was quicker.  And didn't need a pause beforehand.
# I could also try `xnee` or `xte` instead.

# OLD XMACRO SYSTEM: REPLACED BY XDOTOOL
#   #short delay allows me time to release mod keys
#   #otherwise doesn't work in GTK text boxes
#   sleep 0.2

# For some reason the keybindings get reset after running this, so
# force them back to my preferences.
